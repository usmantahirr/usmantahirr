# Hey, I'm Usman Tahir 👋

I'm a full-stack engineer with 10+ years of experience building scalable, production-grade web applications. My core expertise lies in React, Next.js, and Node.js—but recently, I've been building a sophisticated monorepo architecture and diving into blockchain development.

I've built multiple component libraries and design systems over the years. Right now, I'm working on a full-stack **Turborepo setup** that includes:
- A reusable **utility package** for authentication, authorization, and DB connections
- A **UI component library** using **Shadcn/UI**, **Tailwind**, and **Next.js**
- Exploring backend integration using **NestJS** with **shared types**
- Integrating **smart contracts** and **blockchain functionality** into the system

I'm passionate about building clean abstractions, optimizing developer experience (DX), and designing scalable, future-proof systems.

- 🔭 Currently exploring: **Monorepos, shared types, blockchain integration, and advanced AWS setups**
- 💼 Past work includes large-scale frontend apps, design systems, backend APIs, and dev tooling
- 🧠 I care about: **DX, performance, maintainability**, and scalable design patterns
- 🤝 Open to collaborations, OSS contributions, and technical leadership roles
