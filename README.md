# Hey, I'm Usman Tahir 👋

I'm a full-stack engineer with 10+ years of experience crafting scalable, production-grade web applications. My primary expertise lies in React, Next.js, and Node.js—but lately, I've been expanding into AWS cloud infrastructure and the fascinating world of blockchain.

Over the years, I’ve built multiple component libraries, design systems, and developer tools. Right now, I'm working on a modern **monorepo architecture** using Turborepo that brings frontend and backend together in a seamless developer experience.

My current focus includes:
- A reusable **utility package** for authentication, authorization, and database access
- A custom **UI component library** powered by **Shadcn/UI**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Next.js**
- Integrating a **NestJS backend** with **shared types** and smooth inter-package workflows
- Embedding **smart contracts** and blockchain functionality into the stack

I love working at the intersection of clean architecture, modern tooling, and performance-driven development. I'm driven by the pursuit of developer happiness, maintainable codebases, and systems that scale well—both in terms of users and teams.

- 🔭 Currently exploring: **Monorepos, shared types, blockchain integration**, and **advanced AWS serverless tooling**
- 💼 Past work spans large-scale frontend platforms, component libraries, internal tooling, and scalable backend APIs
- 🧠 I care deeply about: **developer experience (DX), performance, clean abstractions**, and sustainable architecture
- 🤝 Always open to collaborations, OSS contributions, mentoring, and Staff+ engineering challenges
