# Hey, I'm Usman Tahir 👋

I'm a full-stack engineer with 10+ years of experience building scalable, production-grade web applications. My core expertise lies in React, Next.js, and Node.js—but recently, I've been diving deep into AWS cloud infrastructure and blockchain development.

I'm passionate about architecting clean systems, optimizing performance, and mentoring developers to build better software together.

- 🔭 Currently exploring: **AWS (Lambda, CDK, ECS)** and **Blockchain (Solidity, smart contracts)**
- 💼 Past work includes large-scale frontend apps, backend APIs, and dev tooling
- 🧠 I care about: **DX (developer experience), performance, maintainability**, and scalable design
- 🤝 Open to collaborations, OSS contributions, and technical leadership roles
